
בעיה עם הרמז משום מה הפעם הראשונה לא מורידה אותו כלל.

לוחץ גם כשנגמר משחק!

כרגע גייםאובר לא נכנס לפעולה בעיה עם הניקוד...

When a cell that has no mines in his neighbors is clicked – uncover the cell and also 
expand to all his neighbors in a recursive way.

The user has 3 Safe-Clicks:
Clicking the Safe-Click button will mark a random covered safe cell (for 1.5 seconds) 
so the user knows that he can safely click that cell.

The user should be able to toggle between Dark-Mode and Light-Mode

Add an “UNDO” button, so the user can undo (some of) his moves

Manually positioned mines
Create a “manually create” mode in which the user first positions
the mines (by clicking cells) and then plays. 

MEGA HINT
Mega-Hint works only once every game. It is used to uncover an area of the board for
2 seconds. Functionality description: (1) Click the “Mega Hint” button (2)
then click the area’s top-left cell (3) then click bottom-right cell.
The whole area will be uncovered for 2 seconds.

Clicking the “Exterminator” button, eliminate 3 of the existing mines, randomly.
 These mines will disappear from the board. Re-calculation of neighbors-count is needed
